<h1>The best action movies according to Siddharth </h1>
<h2>my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>The first time i watched scarface i thought that it's just a movie about a drug mafia and a man who was desperate to win it all for him like money,power and what not..but as the movie proceeds it teaches a lot about the hunger that one carries in their mind to win the things one wants in their life, also the movie shows how relationships gets ruined when one tries to conquer the world....in conclusion, this movie is worth watching as you'll love to see multiple shades of a legend and his Empire.</p><!--add link to the trailer-->

<h3>F**** C***</h3>
<p>a mas who could'nt sleep for 6 months straight due to insomnia starts getting hallucionations which makes his confused and depressed a** unleash the truth about LIFE, i won't tell you anything anymore about this movie obviously because you need to go through the adventure yourself and know the truth about life that we people live in this century....to know more about the movie watch the trailer i'm dropping below...but the reason no one talks about this movie is because "you do not talk about F**** C***". </p> <!--add link to the trailer-->

<h3>Guilty/Demolition</h3>
<p>so firstly we need to appreciate the art of acting that Jake Gyllenhaal has mastered over the decade. there is not a single movie where he has disappointed the audience with his acting....and this is the exact reason that i have selected two of his movies. </p>
<p><h4>Guilty</h4>This movie takes place inside a Police dispatch and not even a single frame is shot outside the dispatch and if you might think that the fact this movie is shot inside a police dispatch will make it boring then you're wrong....i'm sure that you'll love this movie as it is focuses on the main character's personal life with his work.</p><!--add link to the trailer-->
<p><h4>Demolition</h4>well is grief meant to be shown to the world? that's what people expect from the one who has lost someone.....but demolition shows you a different aspect where the mc shows no emotions like he's not in grief but on the other hand nothing makes him happy either, nothing makes him feel full from the inside it's like living inside a empty void....that being said if you like happy and kinda sad vibes like movies you should watch demolition it might even teach you things about life. </p><!--add trailer-->
